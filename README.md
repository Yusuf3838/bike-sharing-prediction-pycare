# Bike-Sharing-Prediction-Regression-Pycaret
Abstract:
In this project, I used regression techniques to predict the total count of rental bikes (cnt) in a bike-sharing system using the "Bike Sharing Dataset." The dataset consists of hourly data containing 17,379 rows and 13 columns, with features such as season, year, month, hour, holiday, weekday, workingday, weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed), and other time-related features. The target variable is the total bike rental count, excluding the casual and registered columns. I used the PyCaret regression module to automate the machine learning pipeline, which included data preprocessing, feature selection, model comparison, and evaluation. After cleaning the dataset by dropping the instant, dteday, casual, and registered columns, we identified the Random Forest Regressor model as the best performer. Among the models evaluated, including CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated the most accurate predictions with an R² of 0.9401 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 26.53. This model effectively forecasted bike rental demand based on environmental and time-based factors, showcasing the utility of PyCaret for efficient model selection and evaluation in predictive tasks.

Overall Summary of Findings:
Tree-Based Models Dominate: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting consistently emerge as top performers across these studies. They achieve high prediction accuracy (R-squared values above 0.9) and handle the complexities of the bike-sharing data effectively.
Feature Engineering is Crucial: The quality and relevance of the features significantly impact model performance. Careful feature engineering, including creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones, is essential for achieving optimal results. Metric Selection Matters: Different performance metrics can lead to different conclusions when comparing models. Choosing a suitable metric that aligns with the goals of the prediction task is crucial. In these studies, metrics like R-squared, RMSE, and MAE were frequently used.

Relating to My Notebook:
My findings using XGBoost as the best model align well with the literature. XGBoost, similar to Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, is a tree-based ensemble method known for its ability to handle complex data and achieve high prediction accuracy.These papers reinforce the value of using PyCaret for tasks like bike-sharing demand prediction. By streamlining model comparison and evaluation, PyCaret enables you to quickly identify top-performing algorithms and build effective prediction models. I hope this review of relevant literature provides you with valuable insights and context for your findings. Let me know if you have any other questions.
