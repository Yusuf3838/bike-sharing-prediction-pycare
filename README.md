# Bike-Sharing-Prediction-Regression-Pycaret ðŸ‘‹ðŸš²

## Abstract
In this project, I used regression techniques to predict the total count of rental bikes (`cnt`) in a bike-sharing system using the "Bike Sharing Dataset." The dataset consists of hourly data containing 17,379 rows and 13 columns, with features such as season, year, month, hour, holiday, weekday, workingday, weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed), and other time-related features. 

The PyCaret regression module was utilized to automate the machine learning pipeline, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model comparison and evaluation

After cleaning the dataset by dropping irrelevant columns, the CatBoost Regressor emerged as the best performer with:
- **RÂ²**: 0.9490
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 25.2830

This project showcases the utility of PyCaret in identifying top-performing models for predictive tasks.
