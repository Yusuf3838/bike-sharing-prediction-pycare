# Bike-Sharing-Prediction-Regression-Pycaret
Abstract:
In this project, I used regression techniques to predict the total count of rental bikes (cnt) in a bike-sharing system using the "Bike Sharing Dataset." The dataset consists of hourly data containing 17,379 rows and 13 columns, with features such as season, year, month, hour, holiday, weekday, workingday, weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed), and other time-related features. The target variable is the total bike rental count, excluding the casual and registered columns. I used the PyCaret regression module to automate the machine learning pipeline, which included data preprocessing, feature selection, model comparison, and evaluation. After cleaning the dataset by dropping the instant, dteday, casual, and registered columns, we identified the Random Forest Regressor model as the best performer. Among the models evaluated, including CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated the most accurate predictions with an RÂ² of 0.9401 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 26.53. This model effectively forecasted bike rental demand based on environmental and time-based factors, showcasing the utility of PyCaret for efficient model selection and evaluation in predictive tasks.
